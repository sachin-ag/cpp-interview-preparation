# cpp-interview-preparation

Hey! Here are some collected resources which I used while preparing for C++ developer interviews. My main focus was jobs in trading firms but these resources are useful for anyone who uses advanced C++. A basic university-level knowledge of C++ is required for understanding some of these questions. Hope you find it useful! Please let me know if there are any errors or some clarification is needed.

Thank you & Best of luck!
